Top 5 schools were charter schools, while bottom five schools were district schools.  
Per student budget did not seem to affect the overall passing scores as the top 5 schools had lower per student budgets than the bottom 5.
Infact, it seems the lower the per student budget across this district the better the math and reading passing percentages were.
Math and Reading scores by grade were consistent across grades in the same school, although based on the data provided once schools were larger than 2,000 students,
the overall passing dropped almost 20%.
Overall Charter schools outperformed District Schools in all areas.
